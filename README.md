## 📦 What is Dhakira?

Dhakira (ذاكرة) is a memory system built to help you save on Arabic text processing costs. Arabic text usually uses 2 to 5 times more tokens than English when working with language models. Dhakira reduces this cost by 60 to 80 percent. It does this by improving how Arabic text is handled at every step.

The system works locally on your computer and supports many Arabic dialects, including Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), Gulf, Egyptian, Levantine, and Maghrebi. You can use Dhakira to remember conversations, store facts, and search through your stored information efficiently.

## ⚙️ Features You Should Know

- **Arabic-First:** Dhakira focuses on Arabic, normalizing dialects to reduce token use by around 18%.
- **Cost Savings:** It uses smart techniques like zero language model retrieval, bilingual prompts, small-sized ("nano") models, and local data storage.
- **Graph Memory Support:** You can organize your stored info as entities and relationships using either NetworkX (default) or Neo4j.
- **Hybrid Search:** Combines powerful search methods — vectors, BM25 matching, and graph search with advanced reranking to find the best results.
- **CPU Only:** Runs all models on your standard CPU. No need for a high-end GPU. The download size is about 600 MB.
- **Flexible Use:** Works both for chatbot memories or as memory for autonomous agents.
